The project to be done by two people



Console:
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend
of AirBnB.

Using the Console
The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the
file console.py by itself:

$ ./console.py

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb)

To quit the console, enter the command quit, or input an EOF signal
(ctrl-D).

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
